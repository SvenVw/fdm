Added expandable rows to the crop rotation table. When a cultivation row is expanded, fields with the cultivation appear on their own rows below, only showing data that is relevant to the cultivation type. Users can select fields and cultivation types in a mixed manner. The field selection will be passed to the harvest or fertilizer addition wizard, so the user no longer needs to deselect fields that they don't want if they have selected the correct fields on the table already.
