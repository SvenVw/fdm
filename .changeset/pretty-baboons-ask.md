Users can now indicate if a field is a buffer strip. Fields marked as buffer strips are excluded from nitrogen and organic matter balances at the farm level, and their nutrient advice and norms are automatically adjusted to zero. The UI now displays informative messages when calculations are skipped for these fields.
