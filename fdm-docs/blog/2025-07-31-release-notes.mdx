This post outlines the recent updates to the FDM libraries: `@svenvw/fdm-core`, `@svenvw/fdm-calculator`, and `@svenvw/fdm-data`. This release introduces a robust derogation management system, implements the 2025 Dutch fertilizer norms, and enhances data management capabilities to provide a more comprehensive and compliant precision farming experience.

### Comprehensive Derogation Management

A significant addition to `@svenvw/fdm-core` is the introduction of a full suite of functions to manage derogations for farms. This is essential for farmers who need to operate under specific exemptions from standard regulations.

*   **Derogation Functions (`@svenvw/fdm-core`):**
    *   `addDerogation`: Allows for the addition of a derogation for a specific farm and year.
    *   `removeDerogation`: Enables the removal of a previously granted derogation.
    *   `listDerogations`: Retrieves a list of derogations per year for a farm.
    *   `isDerogationGrantedForYear`: Checks if a derogation is active for a given year.

### Advanced Farm and Data Management

We've introduced several new features and improvements to give users more granular control over their farm data.

*   **Field Removal (`@svenvw/fdm-core`):**
    *   The new `removeField` function allows for the complete deletion of a field, including all associated data such as cultivations, soil analyses, and fertilizer applications.

*   **Harvest Updates (`@svenvw/fdm-core`):**
    *   The `updateHarvest` function has been added, allowing users to modify the details of a harvest event after it has been created.

*   **Refined Acquiring Methods (`@svenvw/fdm-core`):**
    *   The `b_acquiring_method` options have been refactored to align with the official RVO codes, ensuring better standardization and interoperability.
    *   The `listAvailableAcquiringMethods` function has been introduced to retrieve all possible acquiring method options.

*   **Cultivation Plan Enhancements (`@svenvw/fdm-core`):**
    *   The `getCultivationPlan` function now includes the `b_area` (area in hectares) in its output, providing a more complete overview of the cultivation plan.

### Detailed Implementation of 2025 Dutch Fertilizer Norms

`@svenvw/fdm-calculator` has been significantly updated with the latest Dutch fertilizer regulations for 2025, a critical update for our users in the Netherlands. The new implementation automates the complex calculations for three key usage norms (`gebruiksnormen`), ensuring that farm management plans are compliant with national environmental regulations. For a complete breakdown, you can refer to our detailed documentation on the [2025 Dutch Fertilization Norms](/docs/norms/nl/01-2025).

Hereâ€™s a summary of what the calculator now handles:

*   **1. Nitrogen Usage Norm (`Stikstofgebruiksnorm`):**
    *   The calculator determines the maximum allowable nitrogen application by identifying the main crop and the field's geographical context (soil region and whether it's in a Nutrient-Polluted Area, `NV-gebied`).
    *   It applies specific rules for crops like temporary grassland, potatoes (variety-specific), and maize (derogation-dependent).
    *   Crucially, it also calculates the potential reduction (`korting`) based on the use of catch crops or winter crops in the previous year on sand and loess soils.

*   **2. Phosphate Usage Norm (`Fosfaatgebruiksnorm`):**
    *   This norm is calculated based on the land use type (grassland or arable land) and the soil's phosphate status, which is determined from the latest soil analysis data (P-CaCl2 and P-Al values).
    *   The soil is classified into one of five categories (`Arm` to `Hoog`), each with a corresponding phosphate application limit.

*   **3. Animal Manure Usage Norm (`Dierlijke Mest Gebruiksnorm`):**
    *   This norm is determined by the farm's derogation status for 2025.
    *   For farms with a derogation permit, the norm is adjusted based on whether the field is located in a sensitive area, such as a Nutrient-Polluted Area (`NV-gebied`) or a Groundwater Protection Area (`GWBG-gebied`).

### Data Corrections and Improvements

*   **`brp` Catalogue Update (`@svenvw/fdm-data`):**
    *   The values for `b_lu_yield` in the `brp` cultivation catalogue have been corrected to ensure more accurate yield estimations.

### Bug Fixes and Maintenance

*   **Harvest Removal Bug (`@svenvw/fdm-core`):** A bug that caused an exception when removing a cultivation with an associated harvest has been fixed.
*   **Crop Residue Calculation (`@svenvw/fdm-calculator`):** A fix has been implemented for the calculation of crop residue biomass in the nitrogen balance.
*   **Dependency Updates:** All packages have been updated with the latest dependencies.
