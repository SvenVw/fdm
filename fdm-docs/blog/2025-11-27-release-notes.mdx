This November release marks a major expansion of the Farm Data Model (FDM) capabilities. We are introducing a brand-new **Organic Matter Balance** module, completing the Nitrogen Balance with **Nitrate Leaching** insights, significantly upgrading **Harvest analysis with crop-specific parameters**, and streamlining crop management with the new **Rotation Page**. Alongside these agronomic leaps, we've revamped our documentation and refined the user interface with better map controls and a sharper sidebar.

### FDM Application Enhancements (`@svenvw/fdm-app`)

*   **New Module: Organic Matter Balance:**
    *   We have launched a dedicated **Organic Matter Balance** app. This tool allows farmers and advisors to monitor the effective organic matter (EOM) supply from crops, residues, and fertilizers, ensuring long-term soil health strategy.
*   **Nitrogen Balance Upgrades:**
    *   **Nitrate Leaching Added:** Previously, our balance calculations focused primarily on Ammonia (NH3). With this release, we have added **Nitrate (NO3) Leaching**, providing a complete picture of nitrogen losses. Charts and cards now clearly distinguish between these two emission pathways.
    *   **Field Level:** Nitrate emission specifics are now also visible at the field level.
*   **Enhanced Harvest Analysis with Crop-Specific Parameters:**
    *   **Advanced Analysis:** We've expanded the data model to support detailed harvest analysis, including parameters like **Fresh Yield**, **Tare (%)**, **Dry Matter Content**, **Moisture**, **Underwater Weight**, and **Crude Protein**.
    *   **Smart Forms:** The harvest recording form has been redesigned. It now intelligently requests specific yield and nitrogen parameters based on the crop type.
    *   **User Experience:** The harvest overview is clearer, showing relevant parameters upfront. The "Add Harvest" button is now smartly hidden for non-harvestable cultivations (e.g., green fallow).
*   **Powerful Rotation Page for Crop Management:**
    *   We've introduced the **Rotation Page** that acts as your central command for crop management. It gives a comprehensive overview of all cultivations on your farm. But it's not just for viewing—you can now perform **bulk actions**, such as adding a fertilizer application or a harvest event to *all* fields with a specific crop in one go.
*   **User Interface & Experience Enhancements:**
    *   **Map Controls:** Added a toggle to hide or show field layers, reducing clutter when needed.
    *   **Sidebar:** Improved navigation feedback—active pages are clearly highlighted, and the sidebar now displays the selected farm's name and the user's role.
    *   **Fertilizers:** Added icons to the fields table for quick fertilizer identification.
    *   **Drag-and-Drop:** Refined the upload experience with a dedicated `Dropzone` component, reducing clutter.
*   **Technical:**
    *   Upgraded to **Node.js v24**.
    *   Optimized Vite build configuration for better performance.

### FDM Calculator Upgrades (`@svenvw/fdm-calculator`)

*   **New Calculations:**
    *   **Organic Matter:** Added `calculateOrganicMatterBalance` and `getOrganicMatterBalance` to power the new app module.
    *   **Nitrate Leaching:** Implemented the logic to calculate nitrate leaching, enriching the nitrogen balance model.
    *   **Emission Split:** The nitrogen balance output now formally separates ammonia and nitrate emissions.

### FDM Core Developments (`@svenvw/fdm-core`)

*   **Harvest Logic:**
    *   **Default Values:** Added `getDefaultsForHarvestParameters` to fetch smart defaults for new harvests.
    *   **Automation:** When adding a cultivation defined as 'harvest once', the system now automatically generates a corresponding harvest event with default values.
    *   **New Parameters:** Added `b_lu_dm` (dry matter) and `b_lu_harvestcat` (harvest category) to the cultivation catalogue to standardize calculations.
*   **Organic Matter:**
    *   Added `b_lu_eom` (effective organic matter from crop) and `b_lu_eom_residue` (from residues) to the catalogue.
*   **Auth & Permissions:**
    *   Fixed an issue where organization members did not correctly inherit roles on a farm.

### FDM Data Updates (`@svenvw/fdm-data`)

*   **Catalogue Enrichment (BRP):**
    *   **Organic Matter:** Populated `b_lu_eom` and `b_lu_eom_residue` with default values.
    *   **Harvest Defaults:** Added `b_lu_dm` (dry matter content) and `b_lu_harvestcat` defaults to BRP entries.
    *   **Corrections:** Fixed `nl_6794` (groene braak) to be correctly marked as non-harvestable. Improved default yield values for nature categories.

### FDM Docs (`@svenvw/fdm-docs`)

*   **Revamped Structure:** We have completely overhauled the documentation structure. Beyond technical API references, we have added more in-depth explanations of core concepts and calculation methodologies.
*   **New Content:**
    *   **Organic Matter Balance:** Comprehensive guides on how the balance is calculated and interpreted.
    *   **Nitrate Leaching:** Detailed explanation of the new leaching calculation method.
