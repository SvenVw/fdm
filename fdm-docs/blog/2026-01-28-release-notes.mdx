The January 2026 release of the Farm Data Model (FDM) introduces comprehensive support for buffer strips and updated grassland regulations, alongside new reporting tools and a significant mobile UI overhaul. We have integrated official Dutch soil maps into the Atlas, launched the Bemestingsplan PDF for formal reporting, and refactored our calculation engine to support field-level caching. These updates ensure that FDM remains aligned with 2026 regulatory requirements while improving the daily experience for both mobile and desktop users.

### Compliance and Buffer Strips

To better align with Dutch regulations, we have implemented explicit support for buffer strips across the calculator and application.

*   **Buffer Strip Designation:** Users can now explicitly mark fields as buffer strips.
    *   **Data Model:** We have replaced the derived `b_isproductive` parameter with a stored `b_bufferstrip` parameter. 
    *   **Migration:** For existing fields, `b_bufferstrip` has been initialized based on previous logic to ensure data consistency.
*   **Calculation Logic:**
    *   **Farm Balances:** Fields designated as buffer strips are now excluded from farm-level Nitrogen and Organic Matter balance calculations.
    *   **Norms and Advice:** The calculator automatically sets nitrogen usage norms and nutrient advice to zero for buffer strips, reflecting their lack of *plaatsingsruimte*.
    *   **UI Updates:** The application now displays informative messages when calculations are omitted for these fields.
*   **Grassland Regulations:** We have implemented the nitrogen reduction (*korting*) logic for grassland renewal and destruction for the 2025 and 2026 seasons.

### Reporting and Data Management

*   **Bemestingsplan PDF:** A new "Bemestingsplan" PDF export is available. This report provides an overview of norms, advice, and fertilizer usage at both the farm and field levels.
*   **Crop Rotation Table:**
    *   **Expandable Rows:** The crop rotation table now supports expandable rows, allowing users to see the specific fields associated with each cultivation.
    *   **Workflow Integration:** Field selections made in the rotation table are now carried over to the harvest and fertilizer addition wizards.
*   **Data Export:** A "Copy to Clipboard" button has been added to the Cultivation History view, enabling data export in TSV format for use in spreadsheet software.
*   **Session Persistence:** Filters applied to the field and rotation tables are now stored in session storage, maintaining the user's view when navigating within the application.

### Atlas and Spatial Data

*   **Soil Map Integration:** The BRO "Bodemkaart" (Soil Map) is now integrated into the Atlas, providing official soil classification data for field analysis.
*   **Bulk Addition:** The Atlas now supports adding multiple fields simultaneously through the fields table interface.

### UI/UX and Mobile Improvements

We have refactored several core components to improve responsiveness and accessibility.

*   **Responsive Layouts:** The Field Overview, Header, Sidebar, and Fertilizer Dashboard have been updated to improve usability on smaller screens and mobile devices.
*   **Component Standardization:** All instances of `LoadingSpinner` have been replaced with the standardized shadcn `Spinner` component.
*   **Accessibility:** Improvements have been made to the Cookie Banner and error pages to better support assistive technologies.
*   **Input Validation:** Harvest dates are now validated against sowing and cultivation dates before submission to prevent data entry errors.

### Technical Improvements

*   **Calculation Performance:** We have refactored Nitrogen and Organic Matter balance calculations to use a bottom-up approach (Field -> Farm). This change enables per-field caching, improving performance for farms with many fields.
*   **Security and Authentication:**
    *   **Organization Management:** Organization-related functions have been migrated to use `better-auth` server-side capabilities.
    *   **Cache Privacy:** The `withCalculationCache` function now supports redacting sensitive keys in the cache.
*   **Type Safety:** Fixed the `FdmAuth` type definition to correctly include plugin configurations and settings.
*   **Documentation:** Updated the documentation for 2025 nitrogen usage norms to include rules for grassland renewal and destruction.
