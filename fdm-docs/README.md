# fdm-docs

This repository contains the source code for the Farm Data Model (FDM) documentation website.  Built with Docusaurus, this site aims to provide comprehensive guides, tutorials, and API references for all FDM packages.  We are continually working to expand and improve the documentation to offer clear, accessible, and up-to-date information for developers, agronomists, and anyone interested in using FDM.

## Features

* **Coverage of FDM Ecosystem:** This site documents all FDM packages, including installation, usage examples, and API references.  We strive to provide a central location for all FDM-related information.
* **Navigation and Search:**  Docusaurus provides built-in navigation and search functionality to help you find the information you need quickly.
* **Comprehensive API Documentation:** Provides autogenerated reference documentation for `fdm-core`, `fdm-data`, and `fdm-calculator` based on TypeDoc.
* **Tutorials and Guides:** Offers practical tutorials and guides to help you get started with FDM and its various functionalities, including detailed documentation for nitrogen balance calculation.

## Development

The `fdm-docs` package is part of the `fdm` monorepo. You can use Turbo tasks for development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start local development server
turbo run watch-docs

# Build the static website
turbo run build
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve the FDM documentation! See the contributing guidelines in the main FDM repository for details on how to contribute code, documentation, report bugs, and suggest improvements.
