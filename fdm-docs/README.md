# fdm-docs

This repository contains the source code for the Farm Data Model (FDM) documentation website.  Built with Docusaurus, this site aims to provide comprehensive guides, tutorials, and API references for all FDM packages.  We are continually working to expand and improve the documentation to offer clear, accessible, and up-to-date information for developers, agronomists, and anyone interested in using FDM.

## Features

* **Coverage of FDM Ecosystem:** This site documents all FDM packages, including installation, usage examples, and API references.  We strive to provide a central location for all FDM-related information.
* **Navigation and Search:**  Docusaurus provides built-in navigation and search functionality to help you find the information you need quickly.
* **API Documentation:**  We are working towards providing detailed API documentation for each FDM package.
* **Tutorials and Guides:**  Practical tutorials and guides are planned to help you get started with FDM and its various functionalities.

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start local development server
