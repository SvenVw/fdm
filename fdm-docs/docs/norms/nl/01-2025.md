# 2025 Dutch Legal Norms Calculation



This document explains how the Dutch legal norms for the year 2025 are calculated within the FDM Calculator. These norms are essential for farmers and agronomists to ensure compliance with national regulations regarding the use of nitrogen and phosphate from fertilizers.

The calculations cover three main usage norms (`gebruiksnormen`):
1.  **Nitrogen Usage Norm (`Stikstofgebruiksnorm`)**: The maximum amount of workable nitrogen allowed from all fertilizer types.
2.  **Phosphate Usage Norm (`Fosfaatgebruiksnorm`)**: The maximum amount of phosphate allowed, differentiated by soil phosphate status.
3.  **Animal Manure Usage Norm (`Dierlijke Mest Gebruiksnorm`)**: The maximum amount of nitrogen from animal manure, with specific rules for farms with a derogation permit.

## 1. Required Input Data

To accurately calculate the 2025 norms, the system first collects a comprehensive set of data for a specific field for the calendar year 2025.

*   **Field Information**:
    *   `b_id`: The unique identifier for the field.
    *   `b_centroid`: The geographical coordinates (longitude, latitude) of the field's centroid. This is critical for determining the field's location relative to specific zones (e.g., NV-gebieden, soil regions).

*   **Farm Information**:
    *   `b_id_farm`: The unique identifier for the farm to which the field belongs.
    *   **Derogation Status (`is_derogatie_bedrijf`)**: A boolean value indicating whether the farm has been granted a derogation permit for the year 2025. This status significantly impacts the animal manure usage norm.

*   **Cultivation Data (for the 2025 calendar year)**:
    *   An array of all cultivations on the field during 2025. From this, the `hoofdteelt` (main crop) is determined.
    *   `b_lu_catalogue`: The catalogue code for the crop, used to match against the official norm tables.
    *   `b_lu_variety`: The specific variety of the crop (e.g., for potatoes), which can lead to different nitrogen norms.
    *   `b_lu_end`: The termination date of the cultivation, which is crucial for time-sensitive norms like those for temporary grassland.

*   **Soil Analysis Data**:
    *   The most recent available soil analysis data for the field.
    *   `a_p_cc`: The P-CaCl2 (or P-PAE) value, representing plant-available phosphate.
    *   `a_p_al`: The P-Al value, representing the total phosphate reserve in the soil. These two values are used to determine the phosphate usage norm.

## 2. Nitrogen Usage Norm (`Stikstofgebruiksnorm`)

The nitrogen usage norm determines the maximum total amount of nitrogen (in kg N per hectare) that can be applied to a field. The calculation is a multi-step process designed to find the most specific and accurate norm based on the crop, soil type, and location.

The process is as follows:

### Step 1: Determine the Main Crop (`hoofdteelt`)

From the list of all cultivations on the field in 2025, the system identifies the main crop (`hoofdteelt`). This is typically the crop with the longest duration between May 15th to July 15th. The `b_lu_catalogue` code of this main crop is used as the primary key for finding the applicable norm.

### Step 2: Determine Geographical Context

The system uses the field's centroid coordinates to perform spatial queries against official geographical datasets.

*   **Nutrient-Polluted Area (`NV-gebied`)**: It checks if the field is located within a "Met nutriënten verontreinigde gebied" (NV-gebied). Fields in these areas have stricter (lower) nitrogen norms. This is done by calling `isFieldInNVGebied`.
*   **Soil Region (`Regio`)**: It determines the dominant soil type for the field's location, which maps to one of five regions: `zand_nwc` (sand), `zand_zuid` (sand), `klei` (clay), `veen` (peat), or `loess`. This is done by calling `getRegion`.

### Step 3: Match Cultivation to Nitrogen Standard

The system uses the `b_lu_catalogue` of the main crop to find a matching entry in the `nitrogenStandardsData` table. This table is a direct implementation of the official RVO ["Tabel 2 Stikstof landbouwgrond 2025"](https://www.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2024-12/Tabel-2-Stikstof-landbouwgrond-2025_0.pdf).

### Step 4: Apply Specific Rules and Refinements

For some crops, the standard norm is further refined by a set of specific rules:

*   **Temporary Grassland (`Tijdelijk grasland`)**: For temporary grassland, the norm depends on the cultivation period. The system checks the `b_lu_end` (end date) of the cultivation and matches it to a specific period (e.g., "van 1 januari tot minstens 15 mei") to apply the correct time-sensitive norm.

*   **Potatoes (`Aardappelen`)**: Potato norms are highly dependent on the specific variety (`b_lu_variety`).
    *   The system checks if the variety is listed in `varieties_hoge_norm` (high norm varieties) or `varieties_lage_norm` (low norm varieties), following ["Tabel 2c Consumptieaardappelen hoge of lage norm"](https://www.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2024-12/Tabel-2c-Consumptieaardappelen%20hoge%20of%20lage%20norm-2025.pdf).
    *   If a match is found, the corresponding `norms_hoge_norm` or `norms_lage_norm` is used.
    *   If the variety is not in either list, it falls back to the `norms_overig` (other) category.

*   **Maize (`Mais`)**: For maize, the norm depends on the farm's derogation status.
    *   If `is_derogatie_bedrijf` is `true`, the `derogatie_norms` are applied.
    *   If `is_derogatie_bedrijf` is `false`, the `non_derogatie_norms` are applied.

*   **Outdoor Flowers (`Buitenbloemen`)**: Norms for outdoor flowers are differentiated between 'hoog' (high) and 'overig' (other). The 'hoog' norm is applied if the provided `b_lu_variety` matches a specific list of high-norm flower varieties. Otherwise, the 'overig' norm is used.
    

### Step 5: Select the Final Norm Value

Once the correct set of norms for the cultivation has been identified, the final norm value is selected based on the geographical context determined in Step 2.

*   The system selects the norms for the determined `region` (e.g., `klei`).
*   If `is_nv_area` is `true`, the `nv_area` value is chosen.
*   Otherwise, the `standard` value is chosen.

The final output is a `GebruiksnormResult` object containing the `normValue` (in kg N/ha) and the `normSource` (the description from the RVO table).

## 3. Phosphate Usage Norm (`Fosfaatgebruiksnorm`)

The phosphate usage norm determines the maximum amount of phosphate (in kg P₂O₅ per hectare) that can be applied. This calculation depends on the soil's phosphate status and the type of land use.

### Step 1: Determine Land Type

The system first determines if the main crop is `grasland` (grassland) or `bouwland` (arable land) using the `isCultivationGrasland` function.

### Step 2: Determine Phosphate Class (`FosfaatKlasse`)

Using the soil analysis values `a_p_cc` and `a_p_al`, the system determines the soil's phosphate class. The logic directly implements the official RVO tables for phosphate differentiation.

The class can be one of the following: `Arm`, `Laag`, `Neutraal`, `Ruim`, or `Hoog`.

The classification thresholds are different for grassland and arable land. For example, for **grassland**:
*   If `a_p_cc < 0.8` and `a_p_al < 21`, the class is "Arm".
*   If `a_p_cc > 3.4` and `a_p_al >= 31`, the class is "Hoog".

### Step 3: Look Up the Final Norm

The determined `FosfaatKlasse` and the land type (`grasland` or `bouwland`) are used to look up the final norm value from the `fosfaatNormsData` table.

| Klasse   | Grasland (kg P₂O₅/ha) | Bouwland (kg P₂O₅/ha) |
| :------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Arm      | 120                   | 120                   |
| Laag     | 105                   | 80                    |
| Neutraal | 95                    | 70                    |
| Ruim     | 90                    | 60                    |
| Hoog     | 75                    | 40                    |

The final output is a `FosfaatGebruiksnormResult` object containing the `normValue` and the `normSource` (e.g., "Grasland: Neutraal").

## 4. Animal Manure Usage Norm (`Dierlijke Mest Gebruiksnorm`)

This norm defines the maximum amount of nitrogen from animal manure (in kg N per hectare) that can be applied. The calculation is based on a clear set of rules dependent on the farm's derogation status and location.

The rules are as follows:

1.  **No Derogation**: If the farm does **not** have a derogation permit (`is_derogatie_bedrijf` is `false`), the norm is **170 kg N/ha**.

2.  **With Derogation**: If the farm **has** a derogation permit (`is_derogatie_bedrijf` is `true`), the norm depends on the field's location:
    *   If the field is in a **Nutrient-Polluted Area (`NV-gebied`)** or a **Groundwater Protection Area (`GWBG-gebied`)**, the norm is **190 kg N/ha**.
    *   Otherwise (outside these sensitive areas), the norm is **200 kg N/ha**.

The system checks the location against `NV-gebied` and `GWBG-gebied` vector data to apply the correct norm.
