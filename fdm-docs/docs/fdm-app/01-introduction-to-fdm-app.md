The `fdm-app` is a practical, working example of an application that is built with the Farm Data Model (FDM). It serves as a reference implementation and a showcase of the capabilities of the FDM.

## Features

The `fdm-app` includes the following features:

* **Farm Data Visualization:** You can view your farm data on a map, including field polygon and with tables for your rotation.
* **Action Logging:** You can log the actions that take place on your farm, such as sowing, fertilizing, and harvesting.
* **Data Analysis:** You can use the `fdm-app` to analyze your farm data and gain insights into your nutrient management.

## Technical Stack

The `fdm-app` is built with a technical stack that provides specific functionalities and benefits:

* **Frontend Framework:**
  * **React 19:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  * **React Router 7 (formerly Remix):** Manages both frontend routing and backend data operations, contributing to a cohesive development experience.
  * **Vite:** A build tool that provides fast server starts and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for development.

* **UI & Styling:**
  * **Tailwind CSS 4:** A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.
  * **shadcn/ui (Radix UI):** A collection of re-usable components built on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS, supporting accessibility and modularity.
  * **Framer Motion:** A motion library for React that supports animations and gestures in the UI.
  * **Lucide React:** An icon library that integrates with React applications.
  * **Sonner:** A toast component for displaying notifications and messages to the user.

* **Backend & Data Management:**
  * **PostgreSQL:** An open-source relational database system.
  * **Drizzle ORM:** A TypeScript ORM for interacting with the database in a type-safe way.
  * **@svenvw/fdm-core:** The core Farm Data Model library, providing business logic and data interaction capabilities.
  * **@svenvw/fdm-data:** Standardized agricultural catalogues for consistent data entry and reference.
  * **@svenvw/fdm-calculator:** A library for performing agronomic calculations.

* **Authentication & Authorization:**
  * **Better Auth:** A library for user authentication and session management.
  * **@svenvw/fdm-core (Authorization module):** Manages role-based access control (RBAC) for various FDM resources.

* **GIS & Mapping:**
  * **MapLibre GL JS & React Map GL:** For interactive maps and geospatial data visualization.
  * **Turf.js:** A geospatial library for spatial analysis operations.
  * **Proj4:** A JavaScript library for coordinate transformation.
  * **Flatgeobuf:** An open format for publishing and consuming geospatial data.

* **Error Tracking & Analytics:**
  * **Sentry:** For error tracking and performance monitoring.
  * **PostHog:** For product analytics.

This combination of technologies supports a functional environment for building agricultural applications.

## A Working Application

The `fdm-app` is not just a demo, it is a working application that can be used as inspiration for your own farm management solutions. You can use it as a starting point for your own projects, or you can contribute to its development to help make it even better.
