# Norms and Regulations

The `fdm-calculator` includes functionality to validate agronomic data against regional norms for fertilizer application. This capability supports nutrient management by comparing planned or actual applications against specific regulatory limits.

## Relevance and Data Usage

Calculating norms within FDM utilizes data that is already recorded for other insights, such as field details, crop types, and fertilizer applications. This approach avoids the need for double data entry and allows farmers to view compliance status alongside other agronomic indicators.

Providing these insights is relevant for farmers who need to adhere to environmental regulations to ensure sustainable practices and meet legal requirements.

## System Structure and Extensibility

The norm calculation system in `fdm-calculator` is designed to be extensible across different regions and timeframes. The internal architecture organizes logic by:

*   **Region:** Supporting different countries or regulatory zones (e.g., `NL` for Netherlands).
*   **Year:** Allowing for annual updates to regulations (e.g., `2025`).

This structure enables the addition of new regional rule sets or the updating of existing ones as regulations evolve, without disrupting previous implementations.

## Current Implementation: Netherlands 2025

The current implementation in `fdm-calculator` covers the Dutch nutrient management regulations for the year 2025. This includes the following usage norms (`gebruiksnormen`):

*   **[Nitrogen Usage Norm (`Stikstofgebruiksnorm`)](./nl/2025/stikstofgebruiksnorm.md):** Calculates the maximum total effective nitrogen (in kg N/ha) allowed. The calculation considers factors such as the main crop, geographical location (including `NV-gebieden`), and soil region.
*   **[Phosphate Usage Norm (`Fosfaatgebruiksnorm`)](./nl/2025/fosfaatgebruiksnorm.md):** Determines the maximum amount of phosphate (in kg P₂O₅ per hectare) allowed. This limit is based on the land use type (grassland or arable land) and the phosphate status of the soil.
*   **[Animal Manure Usage Norm (`Dierlijke Mest Gebruiksnorm`)](./nl/2025/dierlijke-mest-gebruiksnorm.md):** Specifies the maximum nitrogen from animal manure (in kg N/ha) permitted. The limit depends on the farm's derogation status and the field's location.

For detailed logic and specific parameters of these norms, refer to their respective pages.

## Customization

The `fdm-calculator` can be extended to support additional norms. The system's modular design allows for the integration of custom configuration files or new logic modules to meet specific regional requirements or certification schemes.
