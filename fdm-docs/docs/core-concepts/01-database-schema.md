title: Database Schema
---

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Farm Data Model (FDM) database schema. It details each schema and table, their properties, and columns, explaining their purpose and how they relate to the overall data structure.

FDM uses a relational database to store its data. The schema is defined using TypeScript and then translated into a physical database schema using a tool called an **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)**.

For information on how this relational data is exported and imported as a portable file, see the [JSON Exchange Format](../data-exchange/json-schema).

> **What is an ORM?**
>
> An ORM is a library that provides a way to interact with a database using an object-oriented programming language. It maps the tables in a database to classes in the code, and the rows in those tables to instances of those classes. This allows developers to work with the database in a more intuitive and natural way, without having to write raw SQL queries.
>
> FDM uses the [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to manage its database schema.

## Schema Overview

The FDM database is organized into four distinct PostgreSQL schemas:

1. **`fdm`**: Contains the core tables related to farm management, fields, cultivations, fertilizers, soil data, etc.
2. **`fdm-authn`**: Handles authentication, storing user accounts, sessions, organizations, and related information.
3. **`fdm-authz`**: Manages authorization, defining roles, permissions, and maintaining an audit trail.
4. **`fdm-calculator`**: Caches calculation results and stores calculation errors to improve performance and provide better debugging capabilities.

## `fdm-calculator` Schema (Calculator)

This schema is used to cache calculation results and store errors that occur during calculations.

#### **`calculationCache`**

**Purpose**: Caches the results of calculations to improve performance.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **calculation_hash** | `text` | Primary Key | A unique hash representing the calculation function and its input. |
| **calculation_function** | `text` | Not Null | The name of the calculation function that was executed. |
| **calculator_version** | `text` | | The version of the calculator that was used. |
| **input** | `jsonb` | Not Null | The input parameters for the calculation. |
| **result** | `jsonb` | Not Null | The result of the calculation. |
| **created_at** | `timestamp with time zone` | Not Null | Timestamp when the calculation was cached (default: now()). |

#### **`calculationErrors`**

**Purpose**: Logs errors that occur during calculations.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **calculation_error_id** | `text` | Primary Key | Unique identifier for the calculation error. |
| **calculation_function** | `text` | | The name of the calculation function that failed. |
| **calculator_version** | `text` | | The version of the calculator that was used. |
| **input** | `jsonb` | | The input parameters for the calculation. |
| **error_message** | `text` | | The error message. |
| **stack_trace** | `text` | | The stack trace of the error. |
| **created_at** | `timestamp with time zone` | Not Null | Timestamp when the error occurred (default: now()). |

## Custom Types

These custom types are defined in `schema-custom-types.ts` to handle specific data representations.

#### **`numericCasted`**

* **Purpose**: A workaround for Drizzle ORM potentially returning `numeric` SQL types as strings. This custom type ensures that numeric values are correctly parsed as numbers (`float`) in the application layer.
* **SQL Type**: `numeric` or `numeric(precision, scale)`
* **Application Type**: `number`
* **Note**: Maps SQL `numeric` to TypeScript `number`. Be aware of potential precision loss for values exceeding JavaScript's `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` range, though this is rare for agricultural data.

#### **`geometry`**

* **Purpose**: Handles PostGIS `geometry` types, allowing storage and retrieval of GeoJSON-like data.
* **SQL Type**: `geometry` (optionally constrained, e.g., `geometry(Polygon, 4326)`)
* **Application Type**: GeoJSON `Geometry` object (e.g., `Polygon`, `MultiPoint`).
* **Dependencies**: Requires the PostGIS extension enabled in the PostgreSQL database.
* **Current Implementation**: The provided code in `schema-custom-types.ts` includes parsing logic primarily for `Polygon` and `MultiPoint` types when reading from the database (especially from hexewkb format). Writing uses `ST_GeomFromGeoJSON`. Support for other geometry types might be limited or require additional parsing logic.
* **SRID**: Assumes SRID 4326 (WGS 84).
* **Note**: Stored as SRID 4326 (WGS 84). Area and distance calculations should cast to `geography` to account for earth curvature.
