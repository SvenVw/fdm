# Contributing to FDM

We welcome contributions to the Farm Data Model (FDM) project! Whether you're a developer, agronomist, or simply an interested user, your contributions can help improve FDM for everyone. There are several ways to get involved:

Your feedback is invaluable in shaping the future of FDM. We encourage you to share your thoughts, suggestions, and experiences. Here are some ways to provide feedback:

* Discussions: Engage in discussions on the [FDM Discussions](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/discussions/). This is a great way to share your ideas and learn from others.
* Direct Communication: For sensitive discussions or security-related matters, you can reach the FDM development team through:
  * [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/security/advisories/new) for security-related issues


## Requesting Features
Have an idea for a new feature that would make FDM even better? We encourage you to submit feature requests. Clearly describe the desired functionality, its potential benefits, and any relevant details. Feature requests can be submitted through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/discussions/categories/ideas)

## Reporting Bugs

Encountered a bug or unexpected behavior? Help us improve FDM by reporting it. A good bug report includes:

* **Clear Description:** Explain the issue in detail, including the steps to reproduce it.
* **Expected Behavior:** Describe what you expected to happen.
* **Actual Behavior:** Describe what actually happened.
* **Environment Details:** Include information about your operating system, FDM package versions, and any other relevant software versions.
* **Screenshots or Videos:** If possible, include screenshots or videos to illustrate the issue when it is related to `fdm-app`

Bug reports can be submitted through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/issues)

## Contributing Code
If you're a developer, you can contribute directly to the FDM codebase. Follow these steps:

* **Fork the Repository:** Fork the relevant FDM monorepo on GitHub.

* **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the purpose of your contribution (e.g., `fix-bug-123`, `add-feature-xyz`).

* **Make Changes:** Implement your changes, following the FDM coding style guidelines.

* **Test Thoroughly:** Test your changes to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce any new issues.

* **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages. Push your branch to your forked repository.

* **Create a Pull Request:** Create a pull request from your branch to the main FDM repository. Clearly describe your changes and their purpose in the pull request description.

* **Review and Merge:** We will review your pull request and provide feedback. Once your changes are approved, they will be merged into the main codebase.

# Documentation Contributions
Improving the FDM documentation is another valuable way to contribute. You can:

* **Fix Errors:** Correct any errors or inaccuracies you find in the documentation.
* **Add Examples:** Provide additional examples to illustrate how to use FDM features.
* **Clarify Explanations:** Improve the clarity and readability of existing documentation.
* **Translate Documentation:** Translate the documentation into other languages to make it accessible to a wider audience.

Documentation contributions can be made by following the same process as code contributions, targeting the `fdm-docs` pacakge.

By contributing to FDM, you're helping to build a valuable resource for the agricultural community. We appreciate your involvement and look forward to your contributions!
