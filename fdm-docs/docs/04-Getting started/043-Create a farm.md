title: Create a farm
---

After setting up your FDM instance, you're ready to start populating it with data. The first step is typically to add a farm using the addFarm function provided by `fdm-core`. This function creates a new farm entry in your database, associating it with a unique identifier.

## Function Signature

```typescript
async function addFarm({
  fdm,
  b_name_farm,
  b_businessid_farm,
  b_address_farm,
  b_postalcode_farm
}: {
  fdm: FdmType;
  b_name_farm: string;
  b_businessid_farm: string | null;
  b_address_farm: string | null;
  b_postalcode_farm: string | null;
}): Promise<{ b_id_farm: string }> {
```

## Parameters
* **fdm:** Your initialized FDM instance. This is the primary interface for interacting with the FDM and is required for all database operations. It's the object you created in the previous page.

* **b_name_farm:** A string representing the name of the farm. This is a required parameter. Choose a descriptive name that clearly identifies the farm.

* **b_businessid_farm:** A string representing the business ID of the farm. This is an optional parameter that can be used to store official business identification numbers.

* **b_address_farm:** A string representing the physical address of the farm. This is an optional parameter.

* **b_postalcode_farm:** A string representing the postal code of the farm's location. This is an optional parameter.

## Return Value
The `addFarm` function returns a Promise that resolves to a value: 

* **b_id_farm:** A unique identifier automatically generated by the FDM for the new farm. This ID is essential for referencing the farm in subsequent operations like adding fields or associating farm actions.

## Error Handling
The `addFarm` function includes robust error handling. It will reject the Promise if:

* The provided fdm instance is invalid or not properly initialized.
* The b_name_farm is not provided or is invalid.
* There are issues with database interaction during the farm creation process.

It's crucial to handle these potential errors in your application logic to ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience. Using a `try...catch block` is the recommended approach.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { addFarm } from '@svenvw/fdm-core';

try {
  const b_id_farm = await addFarm({
    fdm, // The FDM instance created in previous step
    b_name_farm: 'Green Valley Acres',
    b_businessid_farm: 'BUS123456',
    b_address_farm: '123 Farm Road',
    b_postalcode_farm: '1234 AB'
  });
  console.log('Farm added successfully: ', b_id_farm);
  // Further actions using b_id_farm
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error adding farm:', error);
  // Handle error appropriately
}
```

This example demonstrates how to use `addFarm` to create a new farm named "Green Valley Acres" within your FDM instance. The `try...catch` block ensures that potential errors are caught and handled gracefully. Upon successful farm creation, the returned newFarm object contains the farm's ID, which you can then use in subsequent operations.

In the next page we will add a field to the farm.
