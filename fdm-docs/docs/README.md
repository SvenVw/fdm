This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Farm Data Model (FDM). It is designed to help you understand the core concepts of the FDM, learn how to use it in your own applications, and contribute to its development.

## Getting Started

If you are new to the FDM, we recommend that you start by reading the **[Getting Started](./getting-started/01-what-is-fdm.md)** section. This section provides a high-level overview of the FDM and walks you through the basics of using it in your own applications.

## Core Concepts

The **[Core Concepts](./core-concepts/01-database-schema.md)** section provides a detailed explanation of the fundamental components of the FDM. This is the place to go if you want to understand the "what" and the "why" of each concept.

## Agronomic Calculations

The **[Agronomic Calculations](./insights/01-nitrogen-balance.md)** section is dedicated to explaining the calculation engine within the FDM. Here you will find information on how to perform common agronomic calculations, such as nitrogen balance and fertilizer recommendations.

## Contributing to FDM

If you are a developer who wants to contribute to the FDM project, the **[Contributing to FDM](./contributing/01-project-architecture.md)** section is for you. Here you will find information on the project's architecture, how to set up a local development environment, and the release process.

## FDM App

The **[FDM App](./fdm-app/01-introduction-to-fdm-app.md)** section provides a brief introduction to the `fdm-app`, which is a practical, working example of an application that is built with the FDM.
