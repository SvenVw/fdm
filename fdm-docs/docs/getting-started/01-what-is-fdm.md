title: What is FDM?
---

The Farm Data Model (FDM) is an open-source project designed to standardize and simplify the management of agricultural data. Our mission is to provide a robust and flexible data model that empowers agronomists, developers, and researchers to build powerful and interoperable farm management solutions that lowers the barries to deliver latest agronomic insights to farmers.

## What Problem Does FDM Solve?

The agricultural industry is becoming increasingly data-driven. However, farm data is often fragmented, inconsistent, and locked into proprietary systems. This makes it difficult to:

* **Share data** between different applications and services.
* **Analyze data** from multiple sources to gain a holistic view of farm operations.
* **Develop new and innovative** farm management tools.

FDM addresses these challenges by providing a common language for describing farm data. It defines a standardized schema for a wide range of agricultural concepts, including:

* **Farms and Fields:** The core assets of any agricultural operation.
* **Cultivations:** The lifecycle of a crop, from sowing to harvest.
* **Actions:** The various activities that take place on a farm, such as fertilizing, spraying, and soil sampling.
* **Catalogues:** Standardized lists of crops, fertilizers, and other agricultural inputs.

## Who is the Target Audience?

FDM is designed for a diverse audience, including:

* **Agronomists:** FDM provides a structured way to record and analyze farm data, enabling them to make more informed decisions.
* **Developers:** FDM offers a flexible and extensible data model for building a new generation of farm management applications.
* **Researchers:** FDM provides a standardized dataset for conducting research and developing new agricultural technologies.

## What are the Key Features?

* **Standardized Schema:** FDM provides a comprehensive and well-documented schema for a wide range of agricultural data.
* **Calculation Engine:** FDM includes a powerful calculation engine for performing common agronomic calculations, such as nitrogen balance and nutrient recommendations.
* **Open-Source:** FDM is an open-source project, which means it is free to use, modify, and distribute.
* **Extensible:** FDM is designed to be extensible, allowing users to add their own custom data types and calculations.
