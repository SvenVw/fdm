# FDM Calculator (`fdm-calculator`)

The `fdm-calculator` package is **planned** as a key component of the Farm Data Model (FDM) project.  It is currently under development and not yet available for use.  When complete, it will provide a powerful set of tools for performing domain-specific calculations based on the data stored within the FDM schema.

## Planned Features

* **Nutrient Balance Calculations:** Calculate nutrient requirements, uptake, and balances based on crop type, soil analysis, and other relevant factors.
* **Economic Analysis:**  Analyze the economic viability of different farming strategies and provide insights into cost optimization.
* **Environmental Impact Assessments:** Estimate the environmental footprint of farming activities, including greenhouse gas emissions and leaching of nitrogen and phosphate to the environment.
* **Integration with FDM Core:** Seamlessly integrate with `fdm-core` to access and process farm data directly from the database.
* **Customizable Calculations:** Allow users to define and implement their own custom calculations based on specific needs and research models.


## Development Status

This package is currently in the planning stages.  Development will begin soon.  Check back for updates on progress and availability.


## Getting Involved

We encourage contributions and feedback on the development of `fdm-calculator`.  If you have expertise in agricultural calculations, software development, or related fields, you can contribute by:

* **Suggesting Calculation Methods:** Share your expertise by proposing algorithms and formulas for various agricultural calculations.
* **Contributing Code:** Help us build the package by contributing code and implementing calculation logic.
* **Testing and Providing Feedback:** Once a preliminary version is available, test the functionality and provide feedback on its usability and accuracy.

## Made Possible By

FDM is developed by the [NutriÃ«nten Management Instituut](https://www.nmi-agro.nl/) as part of the Horizon Europe projects: [NutriBudget](https://www.nutribudget.eu/) and [PPS BAAT](https://www.handboekbodemenbemesting.nl/nl/handboekbodemenbemesting/pps-baat.htm).
