# FDM Calculator (`fdm-calculator`)

The `fdm-calculator` package is a key component of the Farm Data Model (FDM) project, providing a powerful set of tools for performing domain-specific calculations based on the data stored within the FDM schema.

## Key Features

*   **Nutrient Dose Calculation:** Calculate optimal nutrient doses based on various factors.
*   **Nutrient Balance Calculation:** Determine nutrient balances at both farm and field levels. Currently nitrogen is implemented, and other nutrients planned.
*   **Economic Analysis:**  Analyze the economic viability of different farming strategies and provide insights into cost optimization (*planned*). 
*   **Environmental Impact Assessments:** Estimate the environmental footprint of farming activities, including greenhouse gas emissions and leaching of nitrogen and phosphate to the environment (*planned*).
*   **Integration with FDM Core:** Seamlessly integrates with `fdm-core` to access and process farm data directly from the database.
*   **Customizable Calculations:** Allows users to define and implement their own custom calculations based on specific needs and research models.

## Development Status

This package is currently in alpha state and actively being developed. It provides core functionalities for nutrient dose and nutrient balance calculations.

## Getting Involved

We encourage contributions and feedback on the development of `fdm-calculator`. If you have expertise in agricultural calculations, software development, or related fields, you can contribute by:

*   **Suggesting Calculation Methods:** Share your expertise by proposing algorithms and formulas for various agricultural calculations.
*   **Contributing Code:** Help us build the package by contributing code and implementing calculation logic.
*   **Testing and Providing Feedback:** Test the functionality and provide feedback on its usability and accuracy.

## Made Possible By

FDM is developed by the [NutriÃ«nten Management Instituut](https://www.nmi-agro.nl/) as part of the Horizon Europe projects: [NutriBudget](https://www.nutribudget.eu/) and [PPS BAAT](https://www.handboekbodemenbemesting.nl/nl/handboekbodemenbemesting/pps-baat.htm).
