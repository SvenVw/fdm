/**
 * Calculates the total nitrogen removal from a field, considering both harvest and residue removal.

 * @param cultivations - A list of cultivations on the field.
 * @param harvests - A list of harvests from the field.
 * @param cultivationDetailsMap - A map containing details for each cultivation.
 * @returns The NitrogenRemoval object containing the total amount of Nitrogen removed and the individual harvest and residue values.
