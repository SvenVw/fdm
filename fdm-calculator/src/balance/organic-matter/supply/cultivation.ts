/**
 * Calculates the supply of effective organic matter (EOM) from cultivations like main crops and green manures.
 *
 * This function iterates through a list of cultivations for a field and sums the EOM
 * contributed by each. The EOM value for each cultivation type is retrieved from the
 * cultivation catalogue (`b_lu_eom`), which represents the annual EOM supply in kg/ha/year.
 *
 * The current implementation assumes a direct annual contribution and does not adjust for the
 * exact duration of the cultivation within the year.
 *
 * @param cultivations - An array of cultivation records for the field.
 * @param cultivationDetailsMap - A map containing detailed information for each cultivation type, including its `b_lu_eom` value.
 * @returns An object containing the total EOM supplied by all cultivations and a detailed list of contributions per cultivation.
