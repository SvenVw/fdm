### Patch Changes

- [#442](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/pull/442) [`cc2f9c6`](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/commit/cc2f9c6af3b08980c064ad70b0b03abbb545afa0) Thanks [@SvenVw](https://github.com/SvenVw)! - Fix forwarding headers to reverse proxy for posthog

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- [#427](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/pull/427) [`5566687`](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/commit/556668727b17377ad77ddc090c50fdccdfe67c65) Thanks [@SvenVw](https://github.com/SvenVw)! - Integrated the BRO "Bodemkaart" (Soil Map) into the Atlas

- [#410](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/pull/410) [`44ec6d8`](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/commit/44ec6d8bd3afc5b7874c5111fab16033e756a9a1) Thanks [@BoraIneviNMI](https://github.com/BoraIneviNMI)! - Users can now add multiple fields at once on the atlas also through the fields table.

- [#425](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/pull/425) [`94fc2c5`](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/commit/94fc2c562fa456b803e475c304b62ed5c9fd92cf) Thanks [@SvenVw](https://github.com/SvenVw)! - Adds that the user can download a pdf, "Bemestingsplan", for a farm that gives on farm-level an overview of norms, advices, used fertilizers and on field-level,the norms, advices, soil status and planned fertilizer applications.

- [#377](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/pull/377) [`6bee78e`](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/commit/6bee78e79d936d796c35d4d70a499bcdc6965af3) Thanks [@BoraIneviNMI](https://github.com/BoraIneviNMI)! - Added expandable rows to the crop rotation table. When a cultivation row is expanded, fields with the cultivation appear on their own rows below, only showing data that is relevant to the cultivation type. Users can select fields and cultivation types in a mixed manner. The field selection will be passed to the harvest or fertilizer addition wizard, so the user no longer needs to deselect fields that they don't want if they have selected the correct fields on the table already.

- [#422](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/pull/422) [`6839005`](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/commit/683900597cebf1b7fb330caf0188bef597032486) Thanks [@SvenVw](https://github.com/SvenVw)! - Users can now indicate if a field is a buffer strip. Fields marked as buffer strips are excluded from nitrogen and organic matter balances at the farm level, and their nutrient advice and norms are automatically adjusted to zero. The UI now displays informative messages when calculations are skipped for these fields.

- [#430](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/pull/430) [`661f3e2`](https://github.com/SvenVw/fdm/commit/661f3e2d4a6bf242cc3574538de816912bca9b2f) Thanks [@BoraIneviNMI](https://github.com/BoraIneviNMI)! - Improve the user experience when they come back to the field and rotation tables, by storing their filters in the session storage.

  - **`b_lu_moist`**: Moisture content of the harvested products (%).
  - **`b_lu_uww`**: Underwater weight of the fresh harvested products (g/5kg). This measurement is often used to estimate the starch content and dry matter content of potatoes and other root crops.
